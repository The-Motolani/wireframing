# WIREFRAMING

## What is Wireframing?

A wireframe is a simplified, low-fidelity visual representation or “skeleton” of a webpage, app screen, or software interface. It outlines the layout of UI elements (such as buttons, navigation menus, content blocks, images) and demonstrates how users might interact with the structure — but without detailed styling, colour, or final graphics.

### Why Wireframing is Important in the Design Process

Wireframing plays a crucial role for several reasons:

- Clarifies structure & layout
By mapping out where elements go — navigation, content, images, buttons — wireframes help designers and stakeholders understand the basic layout of the product before investing in detailed visuals.

- Enables early feedback and iteration
Because wireframes are low-fidelity and inexpensive to create, teams can explore multiple layout options, get stakeholder and user feedback, and make changes easily — much cheaper than redesigning after development begins.

- Promotes alignment among stakeholders
Wireframes serve as a shared visual language for designers, developers, product owners, and clients. They help ensure everyone is on the same page about how the system will behave and flow before detailed design and coding start.

- Focuses on functionality and user experience rather than visuals
By omitting aesthetics at first (e.g., colours, fonts, imagery), wireframes let the team concentrate on the underlying structure, interaction flows, and user tasks — the core user experience.

- Saves time and cost
Detecting usability issues, layout problems or navigation flaws early via wireframes reduces the risk of expensive rework during development or after launch.
